# WordGame4
A python project built with the Anvil web platform for my third year Web and Cloud Development module.

You are provided with a random word that is eight letters or more from a dictionary. You are to think of seven four-or-more letter words from the letters from the random word. The app also displays a top ten leaderboard.

[You can try the game online here. Can you get a top ten score?](https://c00240782-wordgame4.anvil.app)
